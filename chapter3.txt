After leaving the restaurant as fast as she could, Sydney gets into her Uber parked directly outside the front door. She quickly gets into the backseat and has a sigh of relief. 

The über driver is playing the David Bowie's Space Oddity. Sydney finds herself slowly nodding to the beat of the song, sparking memories of her summer in "Napa Lake" as a little girl where her camp leader played this song non-stop. 

-Those were the days, she thought.

As her über driver passed by the downtown area on the I-5 she took the time to admire the Seattle Skyline. She passed it everyday but never really took it in. In what would be considered the city life version of "stopping and smelling the flowers" she kept enjoying David Bowie's song in combination of the glamorous lights that draped over the city.
