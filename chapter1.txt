Sidney was nervous staring at her glass of water noticing how the condensation of the glass left the tip of her fingers wet. The waiter made several rounds asking if she wanted to order any drinks while her date arrived.


-No thanks I will just wait a few more minutes, he should be here any minute now. Thank you.

The waiter responds;

- No problem, let me know if you need anything.


A tall gentleman walks into the restaurant, he was impossible to miss with the peculiar way he was dressed. She thought to herself.

- God, some men really need dressing advice when leaving their home. He almost looks like a pimp with that outfit.

He was definitely overdressed for the occasion. A purple velvet blazer with a silky shiny lapel for a top and what seemed like parody of optical illusions for the pants with bright colors and designs.Everything about the outfit was just too loud and screamed for attention.

The hostess pointed directly at Sidney's table inviting him to take take a seat implying your date is over there.

Sydneys heard dropped.

-Oh my goodness, is this my date. Please earth just swallow me now. What the hell did I ever do to Brenda for her to set me up with this blind date? Why did I agree to this?
